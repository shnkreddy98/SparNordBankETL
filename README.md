# Spar Nord Bank (ETL)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Spar Nord Bank ATM Transactions Analysis Project! This project demonstrates the development of a batch ETL pipeline using widely adopted tools and technologies such as Apache Sqoop, Apache PySpark, Amazon S3, and Amazon Redshift. The objective of this project is to extract, transform, and load (ETL) transactional data from a MySQL RDS database into Amazon Redshift, followed by performing analytical queries to derive valuable insights.

## Use Case

Spar Nord Bank needs to optimize its ATM refilling strategy by analyzing ATM usage patterns, particularly withdrawals, and their influencing factors such as weather, time, and location. Additionally, the bank seeks to gain insights into ATM failures and transaction behaviors to enhance overall ATM management and customer service.

## Project Workflow

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Extract transactional data from MySQL RDS using Apache Sqoop and load it into HDFS.
2. **Data Transformation**: Utilize Apache PySpark to transform the extracted data into a format compatible with the target schema, which includes creating dimension and fact tables.
3. **Data Loading**: Load the transformed data from HDFS to Amazon S3.
4. **Redshift Setup**: Create a Redshift cluster, define the schema, and load the data from S3 to Redshift tables.
5. **Data Analysis**: Perform analytical queries on the loaded data to answer business questions and derive insights.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Apache Sqoop**: For data ingestion from MySQL RDS to HDFS.
- **Apache PySpark**: For data transformation and creating dimension and fact tables.
- **Amazon S3**: For storing the transformed data before loading it into Redshift.
- **Amazon Redshift**: For setting up a data warehouse and running analytical queries.

## Data

The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle and contains detailed ATM transactional data along with weather information at the time of the transactions from around 113 ATMs across Denmark for the year 2017. The dataset comprises approximately 2.5 million records and includes various fields such as transaction date and time, ATM status, ATM details, weather conditions, transaction details, and more.

## Data Model

![Data Model](images/data_modelling.png "Data Modelling")

The data model consists of four dimension tables and one fact table:

1. **ATM Dimension**: Contains ATM-related data including ATM ID, manufacturer, and location reference.
2. **Location Dimension**: Contains location data such as city, street name, street number, zip code, latitude, and longitude.
3. **Date Dimension**: Contains time-related data including timestamp, year, month, day, hour, and weekday.
4. **Card Type Dimension**: Contains information about different card types used in transactions.
5. **Transaction Fact**: Contains numerical and transactional data such as currency, service type, transaction amount, message codes, and weather information.

## Approach

![Approach Diagram](images/Approach.png "Approach")

The approach for this project is divided into the following stages:

### 1. Data Extraction

#### Data Ingestion from the RDS to HDFS using Sqoop

##### Sqoop Import command used for importing table from RDS to HDFS:

```sh
sqoop import \
--connect jdbc:mysql://upgraddetest.cyaielc9bmnf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com/testdatabase \
--table SRC_ATM_TRANS \
--username student --password STUDENT123 \
--target-dir /user/ec2-user/ETL_Project/data \
-m 1
```

##### Command used to see the list of imported data in HDFS:

```sh
hadoop fs -ls /user/ec2-user/ETL_Project/data
```

##### Screenshot of the imported data:

![Screenshot](images/data_extraction.png "Output of Data Ingestion Command")

### 2. Data Transformation

PySpark-ETL.ipynb is used here and the points are summarized below:

- Define the input schema using StructType to ensure correct data types.
- Read and verify the data from HDFS.
- Create and clean dimension tables by removing duplicates and ensuring proper primary keys.
- Create the transaction fact table by joining with the dimension tables and cleaning the data.

### 3. Redshift Setup and Data Loading

A Redshift cluster is created, and tables are defined according to the target schema. Data is then copied from the S3 bucket into the respective Redshift tables.

#### Screenshots of the configuration of the RedShift cluster that you have created:

![Redshift Cluster Configuration3](images/rds_setup3.png)

#### Setting up a database in the RedShift cluster and running queries to create the dimension and fact tables

##### Queries to create the various dimension and fact tables with appropriate primary and foreign keys:

1. **Creating Schema**

   ```sql
   create schema etlschema;
   ```
2. **Creating Location Dimension Table**

   ```sql

     street_number int,
     zipcode int,
     lat decimal,
     lon decimal,
     primary key (location_id)
   );
   ```
3. **Creating Card-Type Dimension Table**

   ```sql
   create table etlschema.dim_card_type(
